### Federal Budget - Agreements and Amendments

The Brazilian Constitution allows each parliamentary to allocate a portion of the federal budget for a specific purpose.
But there is a issue that the law also allows the parliamentary indicates the institution (NGO, Association, Foundation, 
public agency) that will receive the money. 
This creates a major risk of embezzlement, if the money is intended to entities controlled by the parlamentary itself or
 such entities are blacklisted and shouldn't work to or with the government.

The federal government publishes the list of thoses entities that received funds by amendments created by 
congresspersons to allocate the federal budget. The files can be dowloaded from 
[Portal de ConvÃªnios - SICONV](http://portal.convenios.gov.br/download-de-dados).

A portuguese version of the data dictionary is avaiable [here](http://portal.convenios.gov.br/images/docs/CGSIS/siconv_dicionario_dados.pdf).

The data model is also avaiable [here](http://portal.convenios.gov.br/images/docs/CGSIS/Modelo_de_Dados_SICONV_v3.jpg).
