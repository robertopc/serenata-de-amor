#### National Register of Inident and Suspended Companies - CEIS

The National Register of Inident and Suspended Companies (CEIS) is an information bank maintained by the Federal
Comptroller General's Office (CGU), whose purpose is to consolidate the relationship of companies and individuals who
have suffered sanctions resulting in a restriction on the right to Participate in bids or to enter into contracts with

The [Law 12.846/2013 (Anti-Corruption Law)](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2013/lei/l12846.htm)
brought the obligation of the public entities, of all the Powers and Spheres of Government, to keep this register
updated. In order to meet this requirement, the CGU has developed the CEIS / CNEP Integrated Registration System, which
is fed directly by entities and is the source of data published in the CEIS.

Several federated entities have registers on the subject, some of them make it possible to consult through CNPJ of
companies and others in list form. The CEIS aims to bring together in a single place a list of distressed people from
the various sources available.

By consolidating data from various sources and translating technical language into a more accessible structure, CEIS
increases transparency on the subject. In addition, in order to preserve the reliability of the information, the CEIS
provides the indication of the source, which allows the user to deepen his / her query if he / she wants direct contact
with the sanctioning body.

The CEIS aims to serve as a reference source for public administration bodies in relation to their purchasing processes.
It also serves as a transparency tool for society in general.
